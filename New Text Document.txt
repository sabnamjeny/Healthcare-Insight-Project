1. Project Introduction
Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze healthcare data and provide insights into various aspects such as patient management, doctor-specific patient counts, feedback scores, billing amounts, and health insurance coverage.

Need for the Project:
In healthcare, having clear insights derived from data is essential for making effective decisions. This dashboard helps to present those insights in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

2. Tools and Technologies Used
Python: For coding and data preprocessing.

SQL: For querying and integrating the healthcare data.

Streamlit: For building an interactive dashboard.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

SQLite: For database management.

Pandas: For data manipulation.

3. Dataset
Source: The dataset used in this project is Healthcare-Dataset.xlsx.

Structure: The dataset contains various patient-related information such as patient ID, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis, doctor details, feedback scores, billing amount, health insurance amount, etc.

4. Features of the Dashboard
The dashboard provides various features such as:

Analysis by Doctor and Patient Feedback

Follow-up Date Distribution

Billing Amount Distribution

Health Insurance Amount Distribution

Age Group-Based Analysis (if relevant data is available)

5. User Guide
How to Use the Dashboard:
Launch the Streamlit dashboard.

Select an analysis option from the sidebar.

View and analyze the corresponding visualizations and results.

6. Code Explanation
SQL Query:

Example: “The SQL query is used to calculate the number of patients based on feedback score, and the result is displayed in the dashboard.”

Pandas DataFrame Manipulation:

Example: “Pandas is used to preprocess the dataset, such as converting date formats, grouping, filtering, etc.”

7. Results and Insights
Key Insights:
Patient Feedback: The analysis shows that most patients are satisfied with the services provided.

Follow-up Date Distribution: Follow-up rates were highest in January.

Billing Amount Distribution: Insights on how billing amounts vary across different categories.

8. Challenges and Solutions
Challenges: Missing values in the data, date format issues, etc.

Solutions: Data preprocessing was done to handle missing values and to correct the date format issues.
